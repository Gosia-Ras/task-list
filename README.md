# Task list

## About

Task list with the functionality of adding new tasks, marking tasks as done and removing tasks from the list.
If any task is entered into the list, two buttons appear: to mark all tasks as done, and to hide all tasks marked as done. 
If all tasks are marked as complete, the mark all button is disabled.
Project done as a part of front-end development course at YouCode.
